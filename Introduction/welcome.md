Hello, and welcome to "Introduction to Analytics using Hadoop"!

My name is Benjamin and I'm very excited to be teaching this course at The Institute for Statistics Education at Statistics.com. I'm currently Adjunct Faculty at Georgetown University teaching Data Analytics, and an active member in Data Community DC. Additionally, I am completing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. Although I'm pretty busy, I love the chance to meet and work with new people, and I am very glad to have the opportunity to be working with you all.

That's the two bit version of my current status. My career started in wireless network analysis and security- where packet captures can reach the Terabytes of data within hours on a single sensor. I was part of a research group contracted to the Intelligence community, attempting to mine actionable intelligence from this data in real time. Hadoop was a big part of that work, and that's when I began working with distributed computing and MapReduce.

I left that community, and with my prior experience working in publishing (at Oxford University Press), I joined another startup leveraging the same data processing techniques to perform large computations calculating the reading level of children's books. Quickly fascinated by NLP, particularly the machine learning parts, I focused my current doctoral research in that field. It turns out that NLP is very well suited for Hadoop type tasks, and you will note language analyses in some of the assignments for this course.

This course will be a little different than other Statistics.com courses you may have taken. Hadoop is a big topic to tackle, particularly in four weeks. We have listed the level as "Intermediate,” even though it is an introductory course- hopefully this small prerequisite will help us all stay on the same page. I will welcome any feedback about the course - please use the "Suggestions” link in the "Need Help” box in the right hand nav bar of the course home page.

We're all in this together! Please introduce yourselves, and list in particular:

* Your name and what you do
* Why you're interested in Hadoop
* What languages you normally program in

And get ready to dive in!
